# Gullak

**Gullak** is a group savings tracking app designed for friends, families, or small communities who want to save together informally — without dealing with wallets, banks, or complex finance tools.

It helps you keep track of every deposit and withdrawal, stay on top of your savings goals, and motivate your group to save more with a friendly leaderboard.

## What it does

- Create or join savings groups
- Set savings goals for each group
- Record deposits and withdrawals
- View full savings history with filters and sorting
- See the top contributors on the group leaderboard
- Encourages friendly competition to save more
- Stay logged in with persistent authentication
- Simple and clean UI focused on clarity

Gullak is not a wallet or a banking app. It doesn't handle real money. Instead, it helps groups keep a digital record of who saved how much, when, and why — making informal savings more organized and transparent.

## Real-World Use Cases

Gullak is ideal for:

- A group of friends saving up for a trip
- Family planning a wedding or celebration
- Classmates pooling funds for a fest
- Communities running informal monthly savings
